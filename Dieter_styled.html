<h1>Dieter Rams:<br>Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
<br>

<h2>
	<p><span>As technology continues to grow day by day, products keep getting their functions updated.</span> Therefore, the design of those products also need to be changed to help the new functions more accessible to users. According to the article “10 Principles for Good Design, this first rule of Dieter Rams seems to apply more precisely in industrial design and architecture, still it could be used to describe the innovation of digital journalism - a huge part of graphic design. While the market of newspaper has existed apparently the whole time, it was recorded that The Telegraph (UK) was one of the very first offices which launched their electronic website in 1994. As time goes by, online newspapers/magazines have become a huge market as more people prefer accessing information through the internet to reading the news in a classic way.</p>
	<br>
	  <p2><span>Design is not only about the look.</span> Design is the tool which instructs users how to use a machine correctly and usefully. A good design should not confuse users about how the product would work. It rather be a brief, general introduction of the product to users, before the instructions paper would be read for more detailed, complicated functions (Rule 2,4). These rules would be ones of the most important rules in web design, or user experience design. As I continue to work on my personal website, this rule has become a goal, sometimes a challenge to me since no matter how unique one wants her website to be, one needs to take a step back one in a while to take a look at the big picture to make sure it is not too “colorful” for the user to access information.</p2> 
  <br>
<br>
  <br>
  <p3><span>Together with the quality of a well-functioned design, the product design should also be pleasant to look at, as well as have a timeless look since the smart consumers’ expectations should be to buy a well-functioned product which looks like it would worth being there for “a lifetime”, both practically and aesthetically speaking</span> (Rule 3,7). To be able to have a desired timeless look, the design of a product should focus on how to get all the needed details covered nicely, and to have as little decorative details as possible. Therefore, those decorative details would be on point that not only helps with the functions but also make the trademark for the product. While doing so would prevent a product from misleading its consumers into thinking that the product could do anything more than its stated function, a minimalist design is an expression of courtesy telling the customers to make their own marks on the product they paid for (Rule 5,6,8,10). </p3>
  <br>
<br>
  <br>
  <p4><span>As we worked on typography projects last semester, these rules tell the truth about how templates should be designed most of the time, from a shortened resumé to a long content book.</span> Rule of paper sizes should always be considered seriously and purposefully, and mostly classic sizes would be chosen instead of odd, out-of-the box sizes, unless there are good reasons stated for a change. Fonts and font sizes are various for us to choose. However, they are all familiar, popular font families which are only enough for any kind of formal templates and have been used since the beginning of the field. Most of the graphic design projects we worked on during school semesters were focused on delivering the content of the products (books, websites, information boards, event posters, film titles, etc.) Apart from the unique style each of us tends to grow into, we need to follow limitations in order to keep the products more informative and less decorative so that the readers would not get confused or distracted by all the extra details. </p4>
  <br>
	<br>
  <br>
  <p5><span>Most importantly, especially for nowadays’ environmental issue, a design of a good product should qualify certain conditions to make the product eco-friendly </span>(Rule 9). As graphic designers, there should be some deep thoughts about how to create eco-friendly products from the beginning of the process such as the type of the materials or the kind of printer to use which benefits both the brand client and the environment itself. While there are better choices in materials and machines to use for eco-friendly purposes, designers must remember that not using something is even better for the environment. Keep that thought in mind would help us consider working on projects more carefully, and prevent us from wasting materials. While doing our school projects at UIC, to make sure only to print our projects when needed without making printing mistakes is the goal of mine, and to always send the failed printed papers to the recycle bins is a must.</p5> 
  <br>
	<br>
  <br>
  <p6><span>So far, it seems like I’m going down the path where most of the principles have been using, though the practice would be flexibly altered as there are certain differences between industrial design/architecture and the graphic field.</span> However, I should have taken eco-friendly issues more seriously in the past and have more thoughts about the origins of the materials, developing printing-judgement skills, etc. Instead, perfect outcomes of the projects were my only concern.</p6>
